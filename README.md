## US Corona Charts

https://us-corona-charts.netlify.app/. **Note**: sadly, the site I get data from doesn't allow the online site to get data for very long, so my site will only work for a few minutes for you before the charts **always** stay blank. However, if you run my code locally on your machine, the charts will work properly.

This project displays some information pertaining to COVID-19 for the US using data from [the Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).

To run (using the Mac command terminal):

```
git clone https://github.com/SirIsaacNeutron/us-corona-charts
cd us-corona-charts
npm i
npm start
```

This website uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), so you'll need to have that installed in order for the above commands to work.
